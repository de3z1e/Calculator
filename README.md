# Calculator
Calculator App in Swift

This is my first Swift application of a basic calculator that fully supports the order of operations with a custom-built parser - it is located inside of the Solver.swift file and is fully extensible for other functions. The parser is completely written in Swift and uses reverse polish notation and the shunting yard algorithm to evaluate functions based on their precedence and associativity. 

Thanks for checking it out.
